# ClassProject

Objectives
The IS 668 class project is designed to provide graduate students with the opportunity to exercise the following skills:
Working together in a small team setting
Performing independent research on technical topics
Practice source code control using github
Integrate many of the technologies used in IS 668 in a single project
Python
Web Development Frameworks (Flask)
HTML and CSS, Bootstrap
Data Base Management
Details
The project objective is to build a web application that provides the functionality of a classroom gradebook, similar, in concept, to the gradebook we commonly use in class. This is a student project - there is no expectation of a professional gradebook. The gradebook shall have the following Basic characteristics and requirements. To receive a grade of B in the project, all Basic Requirements must be implemented.
The project must be deployed on pythonanywhere. If need be, create a team account so that multiple team members can access the account.
The capability to add a student to the class
The capability to delete a student from the class
As a minimum the following data shall be available for each student
First name
Last name
Student id
Students major
Students email address
Initially, there shall be 4 assignments, populated with grades
The capability to change/edit a grade shall be provided
The capability to display the student roster and all grades
The name of the class shall be displayed
The gradebook shall be accessed via username and password
Working together, as a team, is a project requirement.
The gradebook shall have the following Advanced characteristics and requirements. To receive a grade of A in the project, all Advanced Requirements must be implemented.
The capability to add an assignment to the gradebook
The capability to delete an assignment from the gradebook
The capability to display the students aggregate grade (assume all assignment are equally weighted)
The capability to display the student roster and grades, in alphabetical order.
The capability to display the data (all grades and other data) for a single student
Optional Challenge: The ability for more than one user to simultaneously access the gradebook. You will need to do independent research on the Flask Session.
GitHub
Each team is required to create an account on GitHub . You are required to put all code, templates and other resources on this github account. If need be, create a team account so that multiple team members can access the account.
Submission
You are required to submit the following to Blackboard.
A link to your team github account
A link to your pythonanywhere project
A 3 to 5 page write up describing the overall structure of your project, team member contributions and responsibilities, testing methodology, and any other design detail you think is relevant. Please include the database structure you chose (it is assumed that it will be a simple structure). As you proceed with the project, you will have many questions that are not addressed by the requirements and capabilities specified above - as is almost always the case in development projects. It is left to you to make these decisions. Please specify the decisions you made in your write up.
The project is worth 14% of your grade. Both team members shall receive the same grade
The project is due by 11:59 PM EST, May 20.
Good luck and have fun!
